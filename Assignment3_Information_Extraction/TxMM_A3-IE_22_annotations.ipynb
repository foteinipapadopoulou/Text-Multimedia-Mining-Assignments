In 2017, he co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto.\n",

Williams, Hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularised the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks, although they were not the first to propose the approach. Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.\n",

Additionally, many time expressions only include the year, or the year and month. In ISO 8601, the format is strictly `YYYY-MM-DD`, which is in the opposite order, includes hyphens, and is purely numerical. Additionally, the Python `datetime` format requires using the time as well as the date, which is extra information we did not need. Thankfully, the `pandas.to_datetime` function only displays the date format that we need. This also assumes that when we refer to a month or year, we specifically refer to the first date of that time period, which is more specific than is accurate."

            "Yoshua Bengio OC FRS FRSC (born March 5, 1964]) is a Canadian computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks and deep learning. He is a professor at the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research at the Université de Montréal and scientific director of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA).\n",
            "\n",
            "Bengio received the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award (often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Computing\"), together with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun, are sometimes referred to as the \"Godfathers of AI\" and \"Godfathers of Deep Learning\". As of May 2023, he is the most cited computer scientist by h-index.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bengio was born in France to a Jewish family who immigrated to France from Morocco, and then immigrated again to Canada. He received his Bachelor of Science degree (electrical engineering), MSc (computer science) and PhD (computer science) from McGill University.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Bengio brothers lived in Morocco for a year during their father's military service there. His father, Carlo Bengio, was a pharmacist who wrote theatre pieces and ran a Sephardic theatrical troupe in Montreal that played Judeo-Arabic pieces. His mother, Célia Moreno, is also an artist who played in one of the major theatre scenes of Morocco that was run by Tayeb Seddiki in the 1970s.\n",

            "\n",
            "Career and research.\n",
            "\n",
            "After his PhD, Bengio was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT (supervised by Michael I. Jordan) and AT&T Bell Labs. Bengio has been a faculty member at the Université de Montréal since 1993 and is co-director of the Learning in Machines & Brains program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.\n",
            "\n",
            "Along with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, Bengio is considered by Cade Metz as one of the three people most responsible for the advancement of deep learning during the 1990s and 2000s.

        "1. The main matching events that we found from the Python code we created above are in 1970, 2017, 2018, 2023, and May 2023. Particularly, in 1970, Geoffrey Hinton had his graduation, and Yoshua Bengio's mother played in an important theater scene in the 1970s. Moreover, in 2017, Yoshua Bengio was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, while Geoffrey Hinton co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto. In addition, in 2018, they won the Turing Award, with Yoshua Bengio to have the most recent citations per day. From 2013-2023, Geoffrey Hinton worked for both Google and the University of Toronto, while in 2023, Yoshua Bengio was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honour. Lastly, in May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton resigned from Google, and Yoshua Bengio gave two interviews on BBC and Financial Times and was the most cited computer scientist. From these results, it's clear that this model found events that occured for Bengio and Hinton together (the ACM Turing Award in 2018) and in parallel (their separate, but likely linked, public comments on AI in May 2023). However, it also finds coincidences in the same year, such as Hinton graduating with his bachelor's degree in the same decade as Bengio's mother's artist performances.\n",
        "2. Yes, there are quite a few matching events that we didn't discover programmatically. First, in 2017, Yoshua Bengio was nominated Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and received the Marie-Victorin Quebec Prize, which matches with the event in which Geoffrey Hinton co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto. Another matching event was that since 1993, Bengio became a faculty member at the Université de Montréal, and, in the same year, in October, Geoffrey Hinton's articles were available in Scientific American magazine.\n",
        "3. These events were not extracted because, in the first case, the phrase 'same year' was used, but in our solution we didn't take into account events that don't have an explicit date in the sentences. Furthermore, in the second case, the events were not matched because in our code we matched events that had the same date in ISO-8601 format. Our date extraction process meant that the breadth of time expressions like \"1993\" and \"October 1993\" are lost, and falsely refer to the first dates of that year and month, respectively. A different model may account for the range of dates within a month or year and identify intersecting dates between the two biographies."
